**ShellCheckBear**
==================

Check bash/shell scripts for syntactical problems (with understandable
messages), semantical problems as well as subtle caveats and pitfalls.

A gallery of bad code that can be detected is available at
<https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/blob/master/README.md>.

This bear uses the 'shellcheck' tool.
