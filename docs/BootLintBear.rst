Raise several common HTML mistakes in html files that are using
Bootstrap in a fairly "vanilla" way. Vanilla Bootstrap's components/widgets
require their parts of the DOM to conform to certain structures that is
checked. Also, raises issues about certain <meta> tags, HTML5 doctype
declaration, etc. to use bootstrap properly.

For more about the analysis, check Bootlint
